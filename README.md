# ML-labs

This repository contains a collection of machine learning labs covering both theoretical and practical aspects of key ML algorithms and techniques.

## Contents

The repository is organized into several labs, each focusing on a foundational topic in machine learning:

- **Logistic Regression:**  
  Explore the basics of logistic regression for classification tasks, including model formulation, training, and evaluation.

- **Regularization and Feature Selection:**  
  Learn how to combat overfitting using regularization techniques (such as L1 and L2), and how to select relevant features for better model performance.

- **Decision Tree and Ensemble Learning:**  
  Understand decision tree construction, splitting criteria, pruning, and extend to ensemble methods like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting.

- **Support Vector Machines (SVM):**  
  Dive into the theory and application of SVMs for linear and non-linear classification, including kernel methods.

- **Naive Bayes:**  
  Study the principles behind Naive Bayes classifiers and apply them to real-world datasets.

- **Neural Networks (NNs):**  
  Introduce the basics of neural networks, including forward and backward propagation, activation functions, and practical training.

Each lab typically includes:
- Theoretical explanations and derivations
- Practical coding exercises and implementations
- Visualizations and result analysis
